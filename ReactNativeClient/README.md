# How to Run Application on Frontend

1. Download and place the App.js, IssueList.js and package.json files in the React Native project folder e.g. AWESOMEPROJECT.
2. Open the terminal and enter ```npm install``` to download the dependencies.
3. Enter ```npx react-native run-android``` in the terminal to run the application.

# Additional Notes: Warning
1. When running the application, you may notice the following warning: "Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `textStyle` of type `array` supplied to `Cell`, expected `object`.". This is due to some errors with the 
```react-native-table-component``` library, which is no longer being maintained.
